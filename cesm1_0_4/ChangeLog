One-line Summary: Fourth update to the cesm1.0 release code.

The main purpose of the CESM1.0.4 release is to provide the community a version 
of CESM1 that supports the Thermosphere/Ionosphere extension of WACCM (WACCMX) 
and the capability to configure cases using interannual forcing component sets 
(CIAF, DIAF, and GIAF). CESM1.0.4 also includes a "patch" to MPI_RSEND that 
improves cray-gemini interconnect performance on Cray XT6 machines, and it 
contains other enhancements, machine updates, and bug fixes, as noted in this 
section. Aside from these new features, the CESM1.0.4 release is an incremental 
release beyond CESM1.0.3.


Answer-Changing Features in CESM1_0_4

The following changes in the cesm1_0_4 tag will result in most cases not 
producing bit-for-bit results when compared with cesm1_0_3.


  * CAM (Active Atmosphere Model)

     o Climate-preserving changes:
          WACCM:

        + Two bugs were fixed that affect model calculations. First, the 
	  incorrect variable had been passed into the gravity wave calculation 
	  as the molecular diffusion coefficient. Second, the diffusion solver 
	  was using the wrong value as molecular diffusion at the lowest level 
	  at which molecular diffusion is turned on (0.55 hPa, ~53 km). The 
	  correction of these two bugs produces significant answer changes above 
	  100 km, where molecular diffusion is most significant. In particular, 
	  increases in CO2 are significant in the global average above 100 km, 
	  with changes increasing with altitude. Additionally, global average 
	  temperature decreases significantly between 100 and 120 km, and 
	  increases significantly above 120 km.

        + A third bug was fixed to correct the output values of EKGWSPEC, the 
	  effective Kzz diffusion coefficient due to the gravity wave spectrum, 
	  which were low by a factor of 2. This bug fix affects only model output 
	  for this variable, as the correct value of the diffusion coefficient was
	  being used in model calculations prior to the bug fix.

  * CLM (Active Land Model)

     o Climate-preserving changes:
         + The domain and fraction datasets were made to be consistent so answers for 
   	   the following I compset resolutions change: T85_T85, T42_T42, T31_T31, 
	   f10_f10, f45_45, f19_f19, f09_f09, f05_f05, and f02_f02.
         + Dust wet/dry deposition was mislabeled for bin 4. This changes the 
	   coupler history fields and sometimes has a small impact on this DUSTDEP 
	   history field in CLM. 
     o Non-climate-preserving changes:
         + Answers for the default I1850SPINUPCN compset changes as the MOAR forcing 
	   dataset driving this compset were changed to an appropriate 1850 spinup 
	   case.
         + The history variables: CISUN, CISHA, ALPHAPSNSUN, and ALPHAPSNSHA were 
	   fixed rather than writing out gdir.
         + The soil data for PTCLM US-UMB site was corrected.
         + A bug in the datm forcing setting for CLM1PT mode was fixed so that it 
	   runs in "cycle" mode rather than extrapolating when beyond the available 
	   data. This problem caused simulations to be worthless. 


  * dice (Data Ice Model)

     o Climate-preserving changes:
         + bug fix for flux_Qacc -- changes answers for cases using C-type 
	   compsets.
	    
  * Scripts

     o Non-climate-preserving changes:
         + A bugfix was applied to the compset definitions for the following 
	   compsets: E_2000_CN_GLC, E_1850_CN_GLC, F_AMIP_CAM5_CN, F_1850_CN_GLC.
	   In each of these compsets, CN should have been activated, but it was 
           not.

  Directly below is a summary of compsets that are affected by changes in 
  cesm1_0_4; details can be found in the sections that follow.

    WACCM compsets (see CAM/WACCM)
    E_2000_CN_GLC, E_1850_CN_GLC, F_AMIP_CAM5_CN, F_1850_CN_GLC (see Scripts)
    I compsets, using any of the following domains: T85_T85, T42_T42, T31_T31, 
    f10_f10, f45_45, f19_f19, f09_f09, f05_f05, f02_f02 (see CLM)
    A,C,G,D and I compsets (see "bin 4" discussion in CLM)
    C compsets (see dice) 



What's New in CESM1_0_4

  * CAM (Active Atmosphere Model)
      o New features in CAM5.1.1
          + Added WACCM-X. WACCM-X is the extension of WACCM/CAM from the lower 
	    thermosphere to the top of the thermosphere.
          + COSP updates. Included changes are:
              . made several high-level namelist variables that control COSP. The new 
	        options are all meant to reduce cost by running with fewer subcolumns 
		(10) and by only running cosp every 3rd time the radiation is run. The 
		new variables are:
                cosp_amwg
                cosp_lite
                cosp_passive
                cosp_active
                cosp_isccp
              . change the default mode from cosp_runall to cosp_amwg. Add cosp_runall 
	        to the namelist so this mode can still be specified.
              . changed default for cosp_histfile_num from '2' to '1'.
              . changed sub-column outputs to avoid crashes when you specify outputs as
	        'A' on a monthly history file. The subcolumn output is only on by 
		default when explicitly requested via setting either 
		cosp_lfrac_out=.true. or cosp_runall=.true.
              . made COSP compatible with fincl1lonlat -- so that you can run COSP and 
	        save COSP outputs locally.
              . Add checks to keep rain_cv and snow_cv above 0.0
              . Fixed restart bug.
      o Code cleanup and refactoring
          + A reference pressure module has been added and remaining references in the 
	    physics package to the hybrid vertical coordinates have been removed. The 
	    physics package should only need information about the pressures at layer 
	    midpoints and interfaces. It should not depend in any way on the vertical 
	    coordinate used by the dynamical core.
          + The prescribed aerosol data modules were extended to be able to read in 
	    modal aerosol concentrations and aerosol deposition fluxes. This was done 
	    to facilitate development of prescribed Modal Aerosol Model configurations 
	    (in progress).
          + Code refactored for memory reduction in chemistry/mozart/mo_drydep.F90 and 
	    physics/cam/radae.F90
          + Removed CAM specific print_memusage messages
          + CAM build system checks for the existence of a netcdff library
          + mkDepends was modified to relax the restrictions on source file name 
	    matching module name, and only one module per source file.
          + For WACCM-SC, removed QTHERMAL, QRS_AUR, QRS_CO2NIR, QRS_EUV, from the 
	    output files.
      o Bugs fixed
          + Bug fix to pass the correct variable for the molecular diffusion coefficient
	    to the WACCM gravity wave routine.
          + Bug fix to use the correct values of molecular diffusion coefficient in the 
	    vertical diffusion solver at the lowest level at which molecular diffusion is
	    turned on (0.55 hPa) in WACCM.
          + Bug fix to correct the output values of EKGWSPEC, the effective Kzz 
	    diffusion coefficient due to the gravity wave spectrum, which were low by 
	    exactly a factor of 2 in WACCM history output.
          + Bug fix to make restart history files double precision.
          + Fixed a restart problem that occurs when empty_htapes=.true. in some 
	    configurations. Seems to be a problem that occurs with multiple history file 
	    output.
          + Correction to local-time averaged history output.
          + Correction to sathist output of dynamics decomposed variables on the HOMME 
	    grid.
          + Bug fixed for column data using the collect_column_output option when the 
	    same number of columns (but different locations) was used on multiple history 
	    files.
          + Work around for mpi_rsend bug on the Gemini interconnect. The Gemini 
	    interconnect has a performance bug for mpi_rsend and mpi_irsend. CPP flag 
	    _NO_MPI_RSEND was added so that MPI_RSEND and MPI_IRSEND can be redefined 
	    to MPI_SEND. _NO_MPI_RSEND is only set within the CESM scripts.
          + Added correction to O3 chemical loss rate diagnostic.
          + Bugfix for the diagnostic output fields CLDLIQSTR and CLDICESTR. The 
	    previous version was based on state values that did not contain the 
	    tendencies from the macrophysics package.
          + Allocate statement in mo_drydep.F90 not used and was removed. It could have 
	    caused problems with UNSTRUCTURED grids since the nlon_veg and nlat_veg 
	    variables are not defined in that case.
          + Fixed timers in tphysbc.F90 and macrop_driver.F90

  * CICE (Active Ice Model)
      o Supports Gregorian calendar.

  * CLM (Active Land Model) (See CLM User's Guide for details of all the following)
      o The only changes were bugs fixes to CESM1.0.3 as follows
          + A couple issues with CNDV were resolved.
          + A issue with the configure step where it would hang with a bad user_nl_clm 
	    file was fixed.
          + A few issues with history variables was fixed.
          + We fixed it so that you could build with C13 on bluefire.
          + Domain files and fraction files were made to be consistent.
          + A problem with Gregorian input was fixed.
          + Several issues with PTCLM were fixed.
          + Monthly average files are no longer required to be one per month.
          + CLM1PT mode was changed to "cycle" mode by default so that simulations 
	    running beyond the valid data range would NOT be invalidated.
          + A couple problems with PIO were fixed.
          + The I1850SPINUPCN was changed to point to an appropriate 1850 case rather 
	    than a transient case. 

  * POP2 (Active Ocean Model)
      o Minor changes and bugfixes:
          + New default setting for the output restart file format. By default, POP2 
	    restart files are now written in netCDF format. This change was made in 
	    order to preserve b4b restarts on some machines. Note that POP2 cases can 
	    restart from an existing binary restart file, regardless of the format 
	    selected for new output restart files. The POP2 scripts will automatically 
	    detect the format of the old restart file and read it accordingly.
          + Correction to the units for the time-averaged quantity TPOWER.
          + Bugfix for gfortran format-statement problem.
          + MPI_RSEND workaround for cray/gemini performance.
          + Add addtional supported decomposition for the tx0.1 resolution.
          + Minor bugfix for potential problem in N_HEAT and N_SALT diagnostics 
	    computation (there was no bug in the out-of-the-box configuration; only in 
	    customized cases)
          + Recharacterize some arrays in the ecosys_mod.F90 module as assumed-shape 
	    arrays, in order to avoid Intel compiler problem.
      o New POP2 FAQ

  * Scripts
      o Updated machines list. Added new machines (titan,olympus_pgi, olympus_intel,
        janus) and deleted obsolete machines (prototype_columbia, midnight, hopp2, 
	jaguar* (use titan instead))
      o Change default DATM_CPL_CASE for I_1850_SPINUP_3HrWx_CN compset
      o Change CLMQIAN directories for I compsets to under DIN_LOC_ROOT on all machines
      o Bugfixes:
          + Fix: compsets: E_2000_CN_GLC, E_1850_CN_GLC, F_AMIP_CAM5_CN, F_1850_CN_GLC 
	    so CN is turned on as it should
          + Fix: On machine Lynx env_build.xml and env_run.xml references to /ptmp 
	    changed to /glade/scratch
          + Fix: ESMF library path on bluefire no longer points to a temporary area. 
	  
  * Data Models
      o Added support for interannual forcing (IAF) compsets.
      o Update datm domain files for some grids with matching land/atm [T85_T85, T42_T42,
        T31_T31, f10_f10, f45_45, f19_f19, f09_f09, f05_f05, and f02_f02 resolutions] 
	(will change answers).
      o Bugfixes:
          + datm: dust bin 4 wet/dry deposition bug fix -- changes answers in cases with 
	    datm dust.
          + dice: bug fix for flux_Qacc -- changes answers for cases using C-type 
	    compsets.

  * csm_share Code
      o Bugfixes:
          + Minor Bugfix for using Gregorian input calendar
          + Fix CF data string parsing bug for PGI 11.10

One-line Summary: Third update to the cesm1.0 release code.

Answer-Changing Features in CESM1_0_3

The following changes in the cesm1_0_3 tag will result in most cases not 
producing bit-for-bit results when compared with cesm1_0_2.

    * CAM (atm)
          o Note that for scientifically supported compsets, all changes are 
            climate preserving except for CAM5 compsets.
          o Compsets: B_2000_CN_CHEM, B_1850_CN_CHEM, B_1850-2000_CN_CHEM and 
            F_1850_CN_CHEM
                + Climate-preserving changes: change horizontal interpolation 
                  of input datasets to generalize for unstructured grids and 
                  updates to dry deposition.
                + Non-climate-preserving changes: correction to the wet 
                  deposition list (include CH3OOH) and restore lightning NOx 
                  production.
          o Compset: B_2000_TROP_MOZART
                + Climate-preserving changes: change horizontal interpolation of
                  input datasets to generalize for unstructured grids and 
                  updates to dry deposition.
                + Non-climate-preserving changes: update trop_mozart with latest
                  MOZART4 mechanism and include short wavelength photolysis in 
                  tropospheric chemistry.
          o Compsets: B_1850_WACCM, F_1850_WACCM and F_2000_WACCM
                + Climate-preserving changes: change in the co2vmr surface value
                  used in the nlte_fomichev, change horizontal interpolation of 
                  input datasets to generalize for unstructured grids, WACCM 
                  compsets changed to use 'xactive_lnd' method and corrected the
                  reaction: O1D + CCL4 -> 4*CL for WACCM compsets.
                + Non-climate-preserving changes: include CO2 reactions for 
                  WACCM to improve concentrations in upper regions, new 
                  treatment of stratospheric aerosols and correction to the wet
                  deposition list (N2O5 removed from list).
          o Compsets: B_1850_WACCM_CN (waccm_mozart_v1) and B_1850-2005_WACCM_CN
            (waccm_mozart_v1)
                + Climate-preserving changes: change in the co2vmr surface value
                  used in the nlte_fomichev, change horizontal interpolation of
                  input datasets to generalize for unstructured grids, WACCM 
                  compsets changed to use 'xactive_lnd' method and corrected the
                  reaction: O1D + CCL4 -> 4*CL for WACCM compsets. 
          o New Compsets
                + F_SD_CAMCHEM (trop_mozart), F_2000_TROP_MOZART (trop_mozart), 
                  B_2000_WACCM_CN (waccm_mozart), B_1955-2005_WACCM_CN 
                  (waccm_mozart_v1), B_RCP2.6_WACCM_CN (waccm_mozart_v1) 
                  B_RCP4.5_WACCM_CN (waccm_mozart_v1), B_RCP8.5_WACCM_CN 
                  (waccm_mozart_v1), F_1955-2005_WACCM_CN (waccm_mozart), 
                  F_SD_WACCM (waccm_mozart), F_2000_WACCM_SC (waccm_ghg), 
                  F_SD_BAM (trop_bam), F_TROP_STRAT_CHEM (trop_strat_bam_v1).

    * CLM (lnd)
          o Climate-preserving changes:
                + Simulations at T31 for 1850 with the active-land model 
                  (B,E,F, and I compsets) answers will be 
                  greater-than-roundoff-level different from cesm1_0_2 solutions
                  because of a new surface dataset and new initial conditions 
                  that were added in. The new T31 surface dataset uses a new 
                  glacier fraction dataset.
                + Answers MAY be different to roundoff for non-transient 
                  compsets because of the problem documented in the "List of 
                  minor issues for CLM" given under Known Problems for 
                  CESM1.0.2.
                + SNOWLIQ and SNOWICE will be different on history files because
                  of a change to the averaging of these fields. 
          o Non-climate-preserving changes:
                + None

    * POP (ocn)
          o Climate-preserving changes:
                + In all cases using the active-ocean model (B,C, and G 
                  compsets), answers will be greater-than-roundoff-level 
                  different from cesm1_0_2 solutions, because single-precision 
                  constants used in the overflows parameterization have been 
                  changed to double precision in cesm1_0_3.
                + In cases using the active-ocean ecosystem model (any compset 
                  using OCN_TRACER_MODULES="ecosys"), under certain rare 
                  conditions, solutions may not be bit-for-bit with those 
                  generated from previous CESM1 release tags, due to the 
                  improvements made in the robustness of the pH solver. Note 
                  that the the carbonate diagnostics fields (CO3, HCO3, H2CO3) 
                  will be slightly different from previous tags because the 
                  phlo_3d_init value is different from the previous tags.
          o Non-climate-preserving changes:
                + None




What's New in CESM1_0_3

    * CAM (Active Atmosphere Model)
          o Final bug fixes and tuning of CAM-FV w/ cam5 physics on 1 and 2 deg
            grids.
          o All new diagnostics that are being produced for the CESM AR5 
            contributions are available in this release.
          o Update the COSP implementation to work with the cam5 physics 
            package.
          o The "CAM3.1" physics package has been restored. Using the configure
            argument "-phys cam3" now gives a physics package that matches what
            was produced by the CAM3.1 model release. This is mainly useful in 
            an aquaplanet configuration since the land component cannot be 
            reverted to CLM3. To run an aquaplanet configuration that contains 
            the customizations required by the intercomparison experiment 
            protocol use the aquaplanet_cam3 use case (as an argument to 
            build-namelist).
          o Some tuning has been done to allow running the bulk aerosols with 
            the cam5 physics package. Either prescribed bulk aerosols (as used 
            by the cam4 physics package) or prognostic bulk aerosols (via -chem
            trop_bam) can be used. The motivation was to provide a less 
            expensive cam5 configuration which may be useful when modal 
            aerosols are not the focus.
          o The default for deposition velocity calculation is changed to be 
            done in CLM except when modal aerosols are active. This changes 
            answers (but not climate) for all prognostic chemistry schemes 
            affected by dry deposition.
          o Extend unstructured grid functionality to chemistry and cam5 physics
            package (modal aerosols). Because the modal aerosols are doing a 
            dry deposition calculation on the atm grid, a new dataset is 
            required when running SE on the cubed sphere grid (see namelist 
            variable drydep_srf_file).
          o Changes to chemistry code:
                + Provide more intuitive data-timing namelist variables. See, 
                  for example, the new *_cycle_yr, *_fixed_ymd, *_fixed_tod 
                  variables.
                + Update trop_mozart with latest MOZART4 mechanism.
                + Restore lighting NOx production in super_fast_llnl.
                + Give flexibility to the units of the emissions datasets.
                + Use more up-to-date dataset for waccm_ghg forcing.
                + Include CO2 reactions for WACCM to improve concentrations in 
                  upper regions
                + Updates to dry deposition module.
                + Provide an additional optional wet deposition method for gas 
                  phase chemical species.
                + Include short wavelength photolysis in tropospheric chemistry.
                + New treatment of WACCM stratospheric aerosols.
                + New chemistry package added : trop_strat_bam_v1.
                + Adjustments to the trop_mozart chemistry mechanism.
                + Provide dynamic creation of default deposition species lists 
                  namelist settings using master lists.
                + Correction to the wet deposition lists of species for 
                  super_fast_llnl, and waccm_mozart.
          o Add new low resolution FV grid: 2.5x3.33. The physics packages have
            not been tuned at this resolution.
          o Enable 1/4 deg FV cam5.
          o Enable 1/8 deg SE cam4.
          o Change default for number of vertical remappings per physics 
            timestep. Was 1, but now set to 2 for 1/2 deg FV and finer grids. 
            This changes answers for all high resolution (1/2 deg and finer) 
            runs using FV dycore.
          o Allow subcycling in Eulerian dycore. See namelist variable  
            eul_nsplit.
          o Add ability to interpolate fields on the SE grid (cubed sphere) to a
            rectangular grid for history output. See namelist variables 
            interpolate_analysis, interp_nlat, interp_nlon, interp_gridtype, and
            interp_type. This is off by default.
          o Option for history output to be averaged over local time zones. See
            namelist variables lcltod_start and lcltod_stop.
          o Option for history output (columns) along a specified track. See 
            namelist variables sathist_track_infile, sathist_fincl, 
            sathist_mfilt, and sathist_hfilename_spec.
          o Option for history output of multiple single columns. The default is
            for single column specifications to be output as separate variables.
            This option allows all single columns specified in a history file to
            be written as a single variable using the same format that is used 
            to output unstructured grid data. The option is enabled by the new 
            namelist variable collect_column_output. The reason for implementing
            this option is for efficiency in writing single column output.
          o An option was added to the COSP simulator to allow it to be run on a
            subset of the timesteps when the radiation code is run. See the 
            namelist variable cosp_nradsteps.
          o Add argument to configure (-fc_type) to allow specifying which type
            of Fortran compiler is being used when that compiler is being 
            invoked via a generic script (e.g., mpif90 or ftn). This is only 
            needed for CAM standalone builds.
          o Add argument to build-namelist (-ntasks) to produce default FV 
            decomposition settings (npr_yz). This functionality was previously 
            embedded in the CESM scripts and was not available to user's of CAM
            standalone scripts.
          o Code cleanup and refactoring:
                + Modify code to consistently save and reuse the physics buffer
                  indicies rather than invoking a linear search for the indices
                  wherever they are needed.
                + Start refactoring modal_aer_opt module to make use of the
                  rad_constituent interfaces. This will eventually provide a 
                  prescribed modal aerosol capability and fully functioning 
                  diagnostic calculations for radiative forcing.
                + Implement separate drivers for the cam5 macrophysics and 
                  microphysics. The driver for the cam4 macro/micro physics 
                  remains in stratiform.F90.
                + Remove unnecessary passed variables and use statements for the
                  CAM5 cloud microphysics (cldwat2m_micro.F90)
                + Add functionality for a logical flag called 'sub_column' to be
                  passed to the CAM5 microphysics that changes how it works, but
                  with the flag set (false) to reproduce the standard code 
                  (cldwat2m_micro.F90)
                + Refactoring in cam history to allow for extra dimensions in 
                  output fields beyond the current spatial/temporal ones. 
                  Previously the fields in a history file time sample only had 
                  (lon,lat,lev,time) or (ncol,lev,time) dimensions. The "addfld"
                  calls allowed lev to be set to 1, plev or plevp. To work 
                  around this constraint in the past optional flags were added 
                  to the addfld subroutine that allowed more values of lev, but
                  this workaround did not provide extra dimensions. In cases 
                  where multiple non-horizontal dimensions were needed, e.g., 
                  level and optical depth, or level and subcolumn, the 
                  technique employed was to combine multiple dimensions into a 
                  single mixed dimension. We have eliminated the need to do that
                  (in the output field only -- internal data structures still 
                  require this mixed dimension). Optional arguments have been 
                  added to the addfld subroutine which allow defining multiple 
                  dimensions rather than just a single "lev" dimension.
                + Add new namelist groups to the dycores. Continue to move 
                  namelist variables out of the generic cam_inparm group.
                + The old ISCCP simulator has been removed. The current ISCCP 
                  simulator is available as part of the COSP package.

    * CLM (Active Land Model) (See CLM User's Guide for details of all the 
      following)
          o Prognostic Crop model based on AGROIBIS added in:
                + Add "-crop" option to configure (add with CLM_CONFIG_OPTS).
                + Add surface datasets for crop mode for: f19, f10, 1x1_numaIA, 
                  and 1x1_smallvilleIA (also crop datasets with crop AND 
                  irrigation on).
                + Add initial condition file for crop for f19
                + New supported point resolutions for crop: 1x1_numaIA and 
                  1x1_smallvilleIA
                + Add raw vegetation and LAI datasets for use by mksurfdata for
                 crop model for sim_year=2000.
          o Irrigation Model added in:
                + Add "-irrig" option to build-namelist (add with 
                  CLM_BLDNML_OPTS).
                + Add files for irrigation (for f09 and f10).
          o Code cleanup and refactoring:
                + Input and output files can be read/written in parallel using 
                  PIO (Parallel Input/Output package).
                + PIO is used for all Input/Output.
                + Make restart history files NetCDF.
                + Remove a list of old CPP defines, remove misc/preproc.h files.
                + pft-physiology and RTM flow files are now both in NetCDF
                + New precedence for build-namelist options is...
                     1. Values set on the command-line using the -namelist 
                        option (CLM_NAMELIST_OPTS).
                     2. Values read from the file specified by -infile 
                        (user_nl_clm file).
                     3. Datasets from the -clm_usr_name option 
                        (CLM_USRDAT_NAME).
                     4. Values set from a use-case scenario, e.g., -use_case 
                        (CLM_NML_USE_CASE).
                     5. Values from the namelist defaults file.
                + Now "co2_ppmv" only shows up in namelist -- if co2_type is 
                  constant.
                + Also "rtm_nsteps" only shows up in namelist if RTM is on.
                + Now "build-namelist -list" options no longer require a 
                  config_cache file to work.
          o Changes to namelist:
                + Remove Carbon_only and scaled_harvest options.
                + Add suplnitro option which can be set to: NONE, 
                  PROG_CROP_ONLY, or ALL.
                + Remove old PIO namelist items, there's a new drv namelist to 
                  control PIO for all components.
          o New history output variables:
            Add new variables: A5TMIN, A10TMIN, GDD0, GDD8, GDD10, GDD020, 
            GDD820, GDD1020, GDDPLANT, GDDHARV, GDDTSOI, and QIRRIG. All but 
            QIRRIG added for the crop model, QIRRIG added for irrigation model.
          o Changes to boundary datasets:
                + Update fraction, surface and domain file for urbanc_alpha 
                  site.
                + New finidat/fsurdat/fpftdyn files for T31.
                + New grid/topo/frac/domain files for 2.5x3.33/T341.
                + New datasets for use with the land-ice model.

    * POP (Active Ocean Model)
          o Improve robustness of ecosystem-model pH solver.
          o Correct minor problems:
                + netCDF metadata: correct IRON_FLUX units.
                + netCDF metadata: add unlimited time dimension and cell_methods
                  attribute to transport diagnostics.
                + time management: correct time frequency options 'nsecond' and 
                  'nhour'.
                + diagnostics: correct minor memory leak.

    * Driver
          o Add vect_map namelist variable to provide more options for 
            atmosphere to ocean vector mapping.
          o Extend pio_inparm to provide namelist inputs for all components. 
            Components now pick up the pio settings from the driver via the 
            coupling interfaces.
          o Add support for variable orbital years via namelist orb_mode. 
            Controlled by env variables ORBITAL_MODE, ORBITAL_YEAR, and 
            ORBITAL_YEAR_ALIGN.
          o Extend calendar capabilities to better support gregorian calendars 
            and to handle input data calendars better.

    * Scripts (See CESM1.0 User's Guide for details of all the following)
          o Add new scientifically supported compsets (see Scientific Supported
            Model Configurations).

            CLM, and 1/10 degree POP2/CICE).
          o Add "append" option to xmlchange utility in $CASEROOT.
          o Update ESMF default settings to ESMF_5_0_2.
          o Add short-term archiving bug fixes for clm auxiliary files.
          o Long term archiving changes

                 DATM_CPL_YR_END 
          o Add env_run.xml variable to enable run-time changes to orbital 
            values.
                 ORBITAL_MODE, ORBITAL_YEAR, ORBITAL_YEAR_ALIGN 
          o Add env_run.xml variable to specify vectory mapping types.
                 VECT_MAP  
          o Add env_runl.xml variables for enabling pio settings to be done in 
            driver.
                 PIO_ASYNC_INTERFACE, PIO_STRIDE,PIO_ROOT, PIO_NUMTASKS,

One-line Summary: Second update to the cesm1.0 release code.

#  known answer changes

    * All FV runs at 1/2 deg and higher resolution change beyond roundoff due 
	to a change in the FV div4 filter.
    * All WACCM and trop_mozart runs change beyond roundoff due to changes in 
	the lower boundary files for GHGs.
    * All historical runs with cam5 physics change answers beyond roundoff due 
	to updating the prescribed GHG dataset to the AR5 version.
    * All Eulerian T31 runs change beyond roundoff due to tuning parameter 
	changes.
    * All runs with cam5 physics at resolutions different than 1.9x2.5 change 
	answers beyond roundoff due to changes in default tuning parameters.
    * All C- and G-compset cases will be different because of the correction 
	to the application of the evaporation-precipitaion factor to both 
	runoff and precipitation fields (cpl bugfix).
    * All 2000 compsets will be differenct, because CCSM_CO2_PPMV was changed 
	to 367.0 in these compsets.

# atmosphere/CAM

    * Tuning mods for Eulerian T31 resolution used in paleoclimate simulations.
    * Fix for the FV div4 filter. This filter is only turned on by default for 
	1/2 deg and higher resolution grids, so this change only affects 
	answers for those resolutions.
    * Set the lower boundary values of GHGs using the WACCM lower boundary file 
	for all prognostic GHG chemistry schemes. This changes answers beyond 
	roundoff for WACCM runs and for trop_mozart. It doesn't affect 
	trop_mam3 or the superfast_chem schemes.
    * Fix to column pairing algorithm in phys_grid. The bug would cause load 
	balance problems, but not affect answers.
    * Fix the prescribed GHG dataset for cam5 use case. Enables historical run 
	to go through the end of 2005. This changes answers beyond roundoff for 
	cam5 historical runs.
    * Include workaround for slow compilations with the intel compiler.
    * Corrected the default settings for cam5 simulations at resolutions other 
	than 1.9x2.5. This changes answers beyond roundoff for all cam5 
	simulations except those done at 1.9x2.5.

# land/CLM

    * Add a new initial condition file for T31 support.
    * Turn ice_runoff to off for T31.
    * Add ndepmapalgo to namelist:
          o ndepmapalgo = Mapping method from Nitrogen deposition input file 
	to the model resolution. The mapping method can be bilinear,nn,nnoni,
	nnonj,spval,copy; the default is bilinear.
    * Add U10 field to driver and history files (for dust, old U10 field 
	renamed to U10_DUST).
    * Add new single point options for mksurfdata (to override vegetation and 
	soil types).
    * Change some configure options, add -sitespf_pt option to setup urban 
	test sites correctly.

# ice/CICE

    * Parameters for the low-resolution (gx3v7) ice model have been modified, 
	and solutions produced with these settings have been scientifically 
	validated.

# ocn/POP2

    * Parameters for the low-resolution (gx3v7) ocean model are scientifically 
	valid.
    * Minor improvements have been made to POP2 netCDF tavg history fields.

# driver

    * In previous versions, the epbal factor (when activated) was applied to 
	precip, but not runoff. In the cesm1_0_2 release, this problem has 
	been corrected: the epbal factor is now applied to runoff, too.

# share code

    * A workaround for the shr_scam_mod.F90 build issue has been implemented.

# scripts

    * Added support for T31_g37.
    * Moved ${COMP}_NCPL to env_conf.xml.
    * Added START_TOD to env_run.xml.
    * Updated library module to allow CESM1 to build on kraken.
    * Set CCSM_CO2_PPMV for all 2000 compsets to 367.0, which changes answers.
    * Parallelized the archiving scripts for faster turnaround of archiving 
	tasks.

# data, dead, and stub models

    * The stub and dead models are unchanged.
    * The dlnd and docn models are unchanged.
    * The datm and dice models were updated for compatability with share code.
